    --- way of selecting multiple elements with the same class: document.querySelectorAll('.show-modal')

 LECTURE_WORKING WITH CLASSES*****************************
    --- recap: if you want to use the same function in multiple event listeners, then you need to specify that function as a seperate function, then pass that function as an argument to multiple 'addEventListener' methods
    --- need to use adding and removing classed all the time in order to change the appearance of elements on our page because classes allow us to aggregate multiple CSS properties in just one. by adding and removing, we can activate and deactivate certain styles
