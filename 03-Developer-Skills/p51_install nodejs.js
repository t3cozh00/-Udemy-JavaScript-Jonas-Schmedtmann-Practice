   p57_Coding Challenge #1 
   
   Given an array of forecasted maximum temperatures, the thermometer displays a string with these temperatures.

   Example: [17, 21, 23] will print "... 17ºC in 1 days ... 21ºC in 2 days ... 23ºC in 3 days ..."

   Create a function 'printForecast' which takes in an array 'arr' and logs a string like the above to the console.

   Use the problem-solving framework: Understand the problem and break it up into sub-problems!

   TEST DATA 1: [17, 21, 23]
   TEST DATA 2: [12, 5, -5, 0, 4]
