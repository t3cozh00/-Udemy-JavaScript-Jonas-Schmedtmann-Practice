- what is DOM and DOM manipulation
    DOM: document object model, structured represntation of html documents
         created by brower as soon as the html page loads and stored in a tree structure
         allows javascript to access html elements and styles to manipulate them
         such as change text, html attributes, and css styles
         in short, DOM is a connection point between html document and javacript code
- how does DOM work
    DOM and DOM MANIPULATION is not part of JS language. 
    DOM and DOM method is part of something called the web APIs.
- web APIs
    API: application programming interface 
    like libraries that browser implement and we can access from JS code

   /// NOTE: we do not call the function anywhere, we only define the function, then pass it to event handle, it is the js engine who will call this function as soon as the event happens. That's why the function is called only when the event happens(click)
