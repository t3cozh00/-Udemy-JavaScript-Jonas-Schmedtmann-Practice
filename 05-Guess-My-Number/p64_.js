  document.querySelector(): a method select an element in Javascript
                            document is the entry point to the DOM
                            the querySelector method is available on the document object
  document.querySelector().textContent: get the text of the element

/***p65_JAVASCRIPT IN THE BROWSER: DOM AND EVENTS FUNDAMENTALS*****************
- what is DOM and DOM manipulation
    DOM: document object model, structured represntation of html documents
         created by brower as soon as the html page loads and stored in a tree structure
         allows javascript to access html elements and styles to manipulate them
         such as change text, html attributes, and css styles
         in short, DOM is a connection point between html document and javacript code
- how does DOM work
    DOM and DOM MANIPULATION is not part of JS language. 
    DOM and DOM method is part of something called the web APIs.
- web APIs
    API: application programming interface 
    like libraries that browser implement and we can access from JS code

   /// select the button, then use addEventListenr method on the element to attach an event handler, the handle is a function, a function expression.  we pass it directly here into addEventListenr method. the first argument('click') of the method is the name of the event that we're listening for; the second argument is the function value, which contains the codes we want to execute whenever teh event happens
   /// NOTE: we do not call the function anywhere, we only define the function, then pass it to event handle, it is the js engine who will call this function as soon as the event happens. That's why the function is called only when the event happens(click)
